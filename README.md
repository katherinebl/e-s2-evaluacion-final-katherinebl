Hi! :) I'm KatherineBL and this is my TV series search web app.

This exercise is the final test of Adalab sprint 2, the objective is to test our knowledge of javascript.

The exercise consists of developing a web application to search for TV series.

The page has a search field and a "search" button. When the users click on the button, the application must connect to the open API of TVMaze to search the series.

How is it done?

Using the API and fetch, I made a request and select, among all the available data that was returned, the data needed for the app.

The user can select his favorite series by clicking on them, the items will be highlighted to facilitate visual recognition by the user.

Something is missing?

Yes, ideally, when the users refreshes or closes the page, their favorites are still available in the app. This is achieved by saving the data in the local storage, a procedure that requires several steps and I only managed some of them (it's okay, I'm still learning and I feel good with what I've achieved :))

The code to save and remove the data in the local storage are available in the branches local-storage and dev. In the master branch, the one that is published, this code is not available because I don't consider it complete for its function.

Thanks for stopping by! if you have any suggestions or comments you can send an issue or a PR.
